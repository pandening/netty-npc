 * so you just need to register the service. and the ip:port pair
 * of this service.
 *
 * the important point is the ip:port and serviceName
 *
 * you can using the serviceVersion to do the version-control
 * then you can assign some same service with different version, like
 * for service "EchoService", you can register it to zookeeper with
 * 0.0.1 version, and if you want to update your service "EchoService",
 * but you want to contain the old version's service, you can register
 * the same service with different version such as "0.0.2".
